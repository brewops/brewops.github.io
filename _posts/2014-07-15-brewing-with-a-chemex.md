How to make coffee with a [Chemex](http://www.chemexcoffeemaker.com/).

#### Supplies Needed:
1. [Chemex](http://amzn.com/B0000YWF5E)
2. [Square coffee filters](http://amzn.com/B0000CF3HB)
3. [Electric Kettle](http://amzn.com/B005YR0GDA) or some other way to get hot water.
4. [Conical Burr Grinder](http://amzn.com/B0000AR7SY)
5. [Electric Scale](http://amzn.com/B000WJMTNA)

#### Water
Fill the kettle with **cold water**. Avoid using hot water, as it will contain more disolved
solids, which in turn impacts flavor. Heat water to 205 degrees Fahrenheit.

#### Grinding Beans

#### Filter Setup
Unfold the filter paper square into a funnel shape. Place the expanded filter
into the Chemex funnel with the thickest side against the funnel groove.
Wet the filter with a splash of water to seat it against the funnel.
